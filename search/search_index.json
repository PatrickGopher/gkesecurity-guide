Troubleshooting Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions. There are two possible solutions for this: Installing in user space (recommended): Provide the --user flag to the install command and pip will install the package in a user-site location. This is the recommended way. Switching to a homebrewed Python : Upgrade your Python installation to a self-contained solution by installing Python with Homebrew. This should eliminate a lot of problems you may be having with pip . Error: unrecognized theme 'material' If you run into this error, the most common reason is that you installed MkDocs through some package manager (e.g. Homebrew or apt-get ) and the Material theme through pip , so both packages end up in different locations. MkDocs only checks its install location for themes.","title":"Introduction"},{"location":"#welcome-to-mkdocs","text":"For full documentation visit mkdocs.org .","title":"Welcome to MkDocs"},{"location":"#commands","text":"mkdocs new [dir-name] - Create a new project. mkdocs serve - Start the live-reloading docs server. mkdocs build - Build the documentation site. mkdocs help - Print this help message.","title":"Commands"},{"location":"#project-layout","text":"mkdocs.yml # The configuration file. docs/ index.md # The documentation homepage. ... # Other markdown pages, images and other files.","title":"Project layout"},{"location":"#troubleshooting","text":"Installation on macOS When you're running the pre-installed version of Python on macOS, pip tries to install packages in a folder for which your user might not have the adequate permissions.
